# Node.js
## Description
Creating a "Friend's list" using Express server. This application will allow the user to add a friend with the following details:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Date of Birth

We will be creating an application with API endpoints to perform **Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete** operations on the above data using an Express server. we will also learn to provide authenticated access to the endpoints. Finally, we will use cURL and *Postman* to test the implemented endpoints.

## Objectives
- Create API endpoints to perform Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete operations on transient data with an Express server.
- Implement authentication at the session level using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorized access.
